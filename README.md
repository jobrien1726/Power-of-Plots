# Skin Cancer Drug Analysis

### Project Overview

This project analyzes [pre-clinical data](Pymaceuticals/Data) from animal studies for the effect of different potential drug treatments for the squamous cell carcinoma, a common type of skin cancer. The data is a compilation of observations of cancer lessions on mice and subsequent 45 day treatment comparing Capomulin with other drugs such as Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin, or Placebo.

This [python script]() uses Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib to perform statistical analysis and visualize the results of the treatment clinical trials.
